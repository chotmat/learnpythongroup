Char moving to empty tile
Char moving to tile with grass /cutting grass
Char moving to tile with rock / moving rock
Char moving to tile with apple / collecting apple
Char moving to tile with special object? (see Ending level)

Rock/Apple falling down when there is no grass beneath
Enemy moving arroud [only on empty tiles] (first very simle AI)
Adding points (after collecting apples, apple can hit char while falling down)
Timer going down from X amount of seconds

Char lose live after contact with enemy
Char lose live after rock hit it with speed
(u can eat grass under rock, u can't go down and w8 till rock hit you,
I assume char speed > rock/apple falling speed)
Apple/Enemy destroyed after rock hit it with speed

Player losing when timer == 0
Player losing when 0 lives left
Adding final score (points + rest of the time)
Ending level (2 options, collecting all apples or collecting special object)

About level, there are 2 methonds in which Char can go around level and make paths in the grass.
Method 1: http://gamesdbase.com/Media/SYSTEM/MSX/Snap/big/Mr._Do!_-_1984_-_Angel_Studios.jpg

Method 2: https://pausescreen.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/mr-do-snes.jpg

Of course Method 1 will be much easier to do, buttttttt...... :D

On the edge:
Level's name/number
Logo ?
Timer
Live counter
Highscore ?

Outside of the level:
Landing Page
Score message box after level
Losing game message box

More advance ideas:
More types of grass/enemies
More objects like solid walls, doors, keys, item to cut special grass
Power up's - now you can chase enemies, speed buff
Level maker
Highscores
Settings (like music/sound on/off etc.)
List of levels, so player can choose any level or only unblocked one
